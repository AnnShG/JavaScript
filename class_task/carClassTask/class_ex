Create 4 cars view page.
Cars describe – Mark, model, year, color, engineType
When you mouse move on 1 car you retrieve all this information using public class method.

When you mouse move on 2nd car you retrieve all data using extend class method(extra parameter – odometer and also if car odometer is greater than 2000 than mark car as “(used)”).

When you mouse move on 3rd car all values comes from private methods

When you mouse move on 4 car all values comes from static parameters.

I suggest to use on each car separate class
